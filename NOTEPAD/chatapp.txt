HOW DOES CHAT APPLICATION
 

 Peer to peer concept ❓

Backend and frontend(create two folder)

By using javascript(node)...node -v(to check node installation)

npm init -y(Backend server)

library-socket-socket.io(worldwide technology used for communication apps)
=>supports all programming language.
=> Server =>installation =>npm install socket.io => cmd prmpt => Enter => socket.io+version visible

socket doesn't work lonely,it need package

Initialization =>With express => copy source code => create new js file =>paste the code in js file 
=>make modification(console.log('Server running')) => run =>node filename.extension(got error because express not install)
express(lone package)
=>google => Express js =>now run the file

----End of backend support------

FRONT END
=> Create Html file
=>create javascript file and link it with HTML =>defer(load at end)
=>socket.io =>Client =>installation =>From cdn(content delivery network) =>copy =>paste at html
=> initialization =>const socket=io(+Web server number)

backend cmd => nodemon

backend cmd => npm start
server begins to work

Error dispalys bu port(by pass)
socket =>cors:{
orgin:'*'
}
----communication Establishment-----

textarea => button =>(onclick=function name());

Events => Emit cheat sheet =>Serverside => copy whatever you need =>io.on ku keela=> paste
=> pass argument (uid,socketid)

js file => code: socket.on('uid',(msg)=>{ console.log("your id"+msg)
}
 socket.emit('ack','Received')

function send(){

let mess=document.getelementbyid(msg').value

socket.emit('msg',mesage)}


CLIENT SIDE
socket.on('ack'(msg)=>
console.log(msg)});
